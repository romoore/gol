Game of Light
=============

This program is inspired by an interview problem provided to me by Audible.com.
It is not a game, but rather an algorithmic challenge.  It animates solutions
but does not provide much interaction with the user.

Gameplay
--------
The protagonist is a robot with a limited amount of energy that needs to 
navigate to the Source of Light.  The robot can move north, east, south, or
west, and each move costs 1 energy unit.  The location of the Source of Light
is known to the robot, but the landscape contains a number of barriers that
must be navigated around.

The goal is to reach the Source of Light using the minimum energy required.
